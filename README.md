# habbo
Attempt at a remake of Habbo from scratch.


I will write a better readme once it becomes a bit functional.

Goal is to make it fully in NodeJS, using a single front-end and backend. All retro software out there is either still flash-based, or breaks at every step of installation.

No promises though.
